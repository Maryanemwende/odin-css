***ID Selector***
<br>
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
<hr>

***Class Selector***
<br>
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

<hr>
Classes are similarly styled. IDs are unique from the rest. Multiple classes have slight variations.
